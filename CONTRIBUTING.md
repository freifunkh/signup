Help is highly appreciated, if you've got questions feel free to ask.

Commit style

This repo uses so called conventional commits.
Which implies, that the commit messages follow a certain style, which can be learned easily and helps building changelogs and cleaner software in general.



CI/CD is favored

While we're currently not at this point, we'd like to see GitHub actions validate the contents and deploy them upon changes on main.



Hard Fork contributions

This project is largely based on @lemoer's work for the LeineLab,our local Hacker Space.
There is currently no planned effort to backport fixes and changes, which would be questionable at best due to currently lacking abstractions, but surely won't happen until the LeineLab does publicizes the fork.

Thanks for the work @lemoer!
